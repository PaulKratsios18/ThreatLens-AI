# ThreatLens-AI
Spring 2025

## Vision
ThreatLens-AI is an advanced terrorism risk assessment and prediction platform that integrates diverse data sources to forecast potential terrorism hotspots. The project combines machine learning with interactive 3D visualization to create an intuitive and powerful tool for analyzing global security risks. By leveraging historical data, socio-economic indicators, and real-time information, ThreatLens-AI aims to provide valuable insights for security analysts, researchers, and policymakers.
